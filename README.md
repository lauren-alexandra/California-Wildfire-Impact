# California Wildfire Impact

#### Map Package

The map demonstrates wildfire impact across California counties between 2012 and 2022. California Wildfire Impact was created through the use of two data sources: BOE_CityCounty and California Fire Perimeters (subset). BOE_CityCounty was produced by the California State Board of Equalization to represent county boundaries that are inclusive of incorporated cities in May 2023. California Fire Perimeters (subset) is a collection of fires that occurred between 2012 and 2022 taken from the CAL FIRE Wildfire Perimeters and Prescribed Burns feature service. The Counties by Percent Burned layer was assembled by dissolving the wildfire perimeters and intersecting them with BOE_CityCounty, measuring wildfire areas in US Survey Acres, summing those areas by county, and calculating the percentage of areas burned by wildfire to the total area of each county.
